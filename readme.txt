E-commerce shop made on ASP.NET Framework 5 MVC

Punch-Store - a shop made for selling boxing equipment
It wasn't made for educational purpose only. 

To launch the site on local host you need to create a new bot in Telegram and enter the key in the Storebot.cs in Models folder.

After launching the site - type "/Admin/Index" and login in the admin panel using username and password:
	Login "admin"
	Password "Supersecretp@ssw0rd!"

You can add/edit/delete goods and also check the purchases. I recommend You to create a couple of goods to check all functions
of the project. After it's done you can type "Account/List" and check a generated key to login into the Telegram Bot 
you've created. with "/register [key]" command.

Visit the home page of the shop and try to "buy" anything. Cart and checkout forms are completed. After making an order You
will recieve a message from the bot and You can also check the admin panel to review the purchases list in it.

Front-end's made using Bootstrap 4.
